# InstanceTracker

This is a minimalistic instance tracker for lock outs in WoW Classic. It adds
a discrete icon to the minimap, providing an easy overview of instance
visits. It works regardless of who's leader and/or resets the instance.

## Features

- **Faultless detection:** Whether you're playing alone or in a party, new instance's can always be identified.
- **Minimap icon:** With just a glance you can see how many new instances you are able to enter.
- **Data broker:** It acts as a broker so you can easily add it to your favorite display, e.g., Titan Panel.
